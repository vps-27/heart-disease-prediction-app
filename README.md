Heart Disease Prediction App
This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction App built using Logistic Regression and deployed with Streamlit.
I created this project to explore how data science and machine learning can be applied to real-world healthcare problems, especially in predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on key health indicators like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to make it easy for anyone to check their risk of heart disease using simple medical parameters.
The app uses a trained Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person is likely or unlikely to have heart disease.

It’s a simple but meaningful project that helped me understand:
How to clean and prepare health data
How to train and test a Logistic Regression model
How to integrate ML models with Streamlit for real-time predictions
How to deploy projects on Streamlit Cloud

Tech Stack
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Streamlit

Features
Predicts heart disease likelihood from user inputs
Interactive Streamlit interface
Clean layout with instant prediction feedback
Easy to deploy and extend

Model Details
The model was trained using the Heart Disease dataset (commonly found on Kaggle).
It applies Logistic Regression, a simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification problems.
